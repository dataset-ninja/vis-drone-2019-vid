**VisDrone2019-VID Dataset** is a dataset for object detection and identification tasks. It is used in the surveillance domain. 

The dataset consists of 40015 images with 1870277 labeled objects belonging to 12 different classes including *pedestrian*, *car*, *ignored region*, and other: *person*, *motor*, *van*, *bicycle*, *tricycle*, *truck*, *awning tricycle*, *bus*, and *other*.

Images in the VisDrone2019-VID dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 3 (0% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 4 splits in the dataset: *train* (24201 images), *test dev* (6635 images), *test challenge* (6333 images), and *val* (2846 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 3 occlusions: ***no occlusion*** (1039744 instances), ***partial occlusion*** (713376 instances), and ***heavy occlusion*** (117157 instances), or into 2 truncations: ***no truncation*** (1796594 instances) and ***partial truncation*** (73683 instances). Additionally, every image marked with ***sequence*** and ***target id*** tags.
